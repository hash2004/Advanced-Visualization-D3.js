# Data Visualization and Analysis System (DVAS)

## Introduction
This project, the Data Visualization and Analysis System (DVAS), is designed to provide insightful and interactive data visualizations. Utilizing a Flask backend with D3.js on the frontend, DVAS offers a comprehensive suite of tools for data analysis and presentation.

## Features
- **Entity Network Visualization**: Visualize complex networks of entities to uncover relationships and interactions within the data.
- **Topic Analysis**: Utilize natural language processing to analyze and categorize topics, providing a bubble chart visualization for an intuitive understanding of topic distributions.
- **Radial Network Data Visualization**: Offers a unique perspective on data relationships with a radial network layout, enabling users to explore connections in a circular format.
- **Forced-Directed Graph**: Interactive graph that simulates physical forces to represent relationships between entities, making complex networks understandable at a glance.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework used to serve the application and handle backend logic.
- **D3.js**: A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers.
- **JavaScript/HTML/CSS**: For frontend development, creating interactive user interfaces and visualizations.
- **Python**: Backend scripting for data processing and server management.
- **JSON**: Data storage and transfer between the frontend and backend.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python and Flask are installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `python app.py` to start the Flask server.
4. Access the web interface via `localhost:5001` in your web browser.

## Usage
- Navigate through the application's web interface to access different types of visualizations.
- Use the interactive features of each visualization to explore and analyze the data effectively.

## Contributions
This project is open to contributions. If you have ideas or improvements, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.

## WARNING
The web application of the project is unoptimized right now. Lags are expected. To view the graphs seamlessly, open induvisual JS files for each.
